          My innate curiosity and desire for adventures led me to test myself in
          several industries and positions. Baker, teacher, carpenter, social
          worker, shop manager. Name one job, and I likely did it. But with some
          constants: my commitment to achieving company goals, my unstoppable
          strive for delivering customers' satisfaction, my unremitting care for
          my fellow teammates.

          Lifelong learning is my philosophy, so on top of a Master in Foreign
          Affairs I just added a Bachelor of IT. Still, I have no intention to
          stop studying any soon. At the moment I'm busy exploring .NET
          framework, learning Python and digging into cloud computing.

          <header>My Future</header>
          My goal is to start a rewarding career as a software developer. I
          envision myself as a member of a well-rounded, ground-breaker,
          ruthless team of high-level reachers tech geeks, always ready to
          tackle a problem and transform it into an opportunity.
