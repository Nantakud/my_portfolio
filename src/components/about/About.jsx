          <h1>My past</h1>
          My innate curiosity and desire for adventures led me to test myself in
          several industries and positions. Baker, teacher, carpenter, social
          worker, shop manager. Name one job, and I likely did it. But with some
          constants: my commitment to achieving company goals, my unstoppable
          strive for delivering customers' satisfaction, my unremitting care for
          my fellow teammates.

          <h1>My Present</h1>
          Lifelong learning is my philosophy, so on top of a Master in Foreign
          Affairs I just added a Bachelor of IT. Still, I have no intention to
          stop studying any soon. At the moment I'm busy exploring .NET
          framework, learning Python and digging into cloud computing.
